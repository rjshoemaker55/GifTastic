# gif finder

This app is designed to allow users to pull gifs from the GIPHY API. It will pull 10 images at a time as the user presses the buttons.

The user can also add their own buttons using the input field. They can choose whether the existing gifs should persist on the page, or be removed when the next ten come in.

Lastly, the user can click each gif to animate it, then click again to stop it.
